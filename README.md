1)	Name of the game
2)	game detail page URL
3)	status code for each page URL


Sample Output - 


#	Game name	Page URL	Page Status

2. String reversal
PROBLEM DEFINITION
You are required to write a function which will generate the reverse of a given string according to the following rules. 
●	Reverse each word in the input string.
●	The order of the words will be unchanged.
●	A word could be made up of letters and/or numbers.
●	Other characters (spaces, punctuation) will not be reversed.


NOTES

❖	You are required to provide written test cases to verify correct implementation of this function.
❖	Report a potential bug. (This should not actually exist in your implementation but come up with a bug which could potentially exist in such a requirement and report it. )
❖	You are free to use any programming language of your choice to implement this code. 
❖	The code should work with all types of possible inputs (alphanumeric, special characters, unicode characters etc.)
❖	Spaces, punctuation & other special characters should not be reversed.
❖	Write production quality code.
❖	The template below is in Python and working solution is preferred (assert in main() should succeed)
❖	Bonus points for good testcases.
